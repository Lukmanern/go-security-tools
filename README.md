## [j3ssie/Osmedeus](https://github.com/j3ssie/osmedeus) - A Workflow Engine for Offensive Security

Key Features of Osmedeus

- Significantly speed up your recon process
- Organize your scan results
- Efficiently to customize and optimize your recon process
- Seamlessly integrate with new public and private tools
- Easy to scale across large number of targets

## [kitabisa/teler](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler) - Real-time HTTP Intrusion Detection

Features

- Real-time: Analyze logs and identify suspicious activity in real-time.
- Alerting: teler provides alerting when a threat is detected, push notifications include Slack, Mattermost, Telegram and Discord.
- Monitoring: We've our own metrics if you want to monitor threats easily, and we use Prometheus for that.
- Logging: is also provided in file form or sends detected threats to the Zinc logs search engine.
- Latest resources: Collections is continuously up-to-date.
- Minimal configuration: You can just run it against your log file, write the log format and let teler analyze the log and show you alerts!
- Flexible log formats: teler allows any custom log format string! It all depends on how you write the log format in configuration file.
- Custom threat rules: Want to reach a wider range of threats instead of engine-based (default) rules? You can customize threat rules!
- Incremental log processing: Need data persistence rather than [buffer stream](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stdbuf)? teler has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on-disk persistence options.

## [pwnesia/dnstake](https://github.com/pwnesia/dnstake) â€” A fast tool to check missing hosted DNS zones that can lead to subdomain takeover

What is a DNS takeover?

DNS takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) or domain has its authoritative nameserver set to a provider (e.g. AWS Route 53, Akamai, Microsoft Azure, etc.) but the hosted zone has been removed or deleted. Consequently, when making a [request for DNS records](https://www.diggui.com/#type=A&hostname=github.technology&nameserver=public&public=8.8.8.8&specify=&clientsubnet=&tcp=def&transport=def&mapped=def&nssearch=def&trace=def&recurse=def&edns=def&dnssec=def&subnet=def&cookie=def&all=def&cmd=def&question=def&answer=def&authority=def&additional=def&comments=def&stats=def&multiline=def&short=def&colorize=on) the server responds with a SERVFAIL error. This allows an attacker to create the missing hosted zone on the service that was being used and thus control all DNS records for that (sub)domain.
